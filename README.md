Make Sure to backup the TF Folder! This is an EXPEREMENTAL Hud!

1. Press `Download Zip` on Github. This will download `ANRKHud-master.zip`
2. Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf`
3. Create a folder named `custom` if it does not already exist
4. Extract .zip file contents into `custom` directory. You may rename the top folder whatever you wish.

The final file structure should be like the following:
```
tf

        ├── scripts
        ├── sound
